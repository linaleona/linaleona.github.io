Hello, my Name is Lina Gildenstern and I'm 25 years old. I am a student majoring in American studies, with a focus on anglophone/postcolonial literature, queer and critical race theory. 
I am also interested in skincare and generally everything that is nowadays labeled as self-care. A healthy work-life balance is the key to a successfull, healthy, stressfree and happy life.
